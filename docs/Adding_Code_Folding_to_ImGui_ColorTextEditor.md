# Adding Code Folding to ImGui ColorTextEditor

The `ColorTextEditor` in ImGui is a lightweight text editor designed for applications that need syntax highlighting and basic text editing capabilities. Adding **code folding** to this editor can significantly enhance its usability for large files or complex scripts. Below are the steps and considerations for implementing code folding in the `ColorTextEditor`.

---

## **Steps to Add Code Folding**

### 1. **Understand Code Folding Logic**
   - Code folding is typically implemented by detecting regions of text that can be collapsed or expanded.
   - Regions are often defined by specific syntax (e.g., `{ ... }` in C-like languages, or `#region`/`#endregion` in C#).

---

### 2. **Modify the Internal Data Structure**
   - Add a data structure to track foldable regions:
     ```cpp
     struct FoldRegion {
         int startLine;
         int endLine;
         bool isCollapsed;
     };

     std::vector<FoldRegion> foldRegions;
     ```
   - Each `FoldRegion` contains:
     - `startLine`: The line where the region starts.
     - `endLine`: The line where the region ends.
     - `isCollapsed`: Whether the region is currently folded.

---

### 3. **Parse the Text**
   - Extend the parsing logic to identify foldable regions:
     - Scan the text buffer to find opening and closing tokens (e.g., `{` and `}`).
     - Populate the `foldRegions` vector with the detected regions.

---

### 4. **Rendering Folded Regions**
   - Modify the rendering loop to skip lines in collapsed regions:
     ```cpp
     for (int line = 0; line < textBuffer.size(); ++line) {
         if (IsLineInCollapsedRegion(line)) {
             continue;
         }
         RenderLine(line);
     }
     ```

   - Add a helper function to determine if a line is in a collapsed region:
     ```cpp
     bool IsLineInCollapsedRegion(int line) {
         for (const auto& region : foldRegions) {
             if (region.isCollapsed && line > region.startLine && line <= region.endLine) {
                 return true;
             }
         }
         return false;
     }
     ```

---

### 5. **Add Toggle Buttons**
   - Render a fold/unfold button in the gutter for each foldable region:
     ```cpp
     if (IsLineStartOfRegion(line)) {
         if (ImGui::SmallButton(region.isCollapsed ? "+" : "-")) {
             region.isCollapsed = !region.isCollapsed;
         }
     }
     ```

---

### 6. **Redraw Logic**
   - Trigger a re-render whenever a region is folded or unfolded:
     - Update the visible text buffer to exclude lines in collapsed regions.
     - Ensure proper scroll handling for large files.

---

## **Considerations**
- **Performance:** Optimize region parsing for large files to avoid slowdowns.
- **User Feedback:** Provide visual indicators for foldable regions.
- **Customization:** Allow users to define custom folding markers via settings or callbacks.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add shortcut keys for folding/unfolding regions.
- Implement a minimap to visualize folded sections.
- Support nested folding regions for hierarchical code.

---

### Example Visualization:
```plaintext
1. void Function() {
2.     if (condition) {   // [+] Button to fold/unfold
3.         // Some code
4.     }
5. }
```
