Absolutely, desktop apps could make a comeback over web apps, especially with the availability of distribution platforms like the Mac App Store, Microsoft Store, and even cross-platform solutions like Steam or Setapp. Here’s a breakdown of why desktop apps could regain popularity and the factors influencing this potential shift:

1. Why Desktop Apps Might Make a Comeback
Better Performance
Desktop apps generally outperform web apps because they run directly on the hardware and operating system, without relying on a browser's engine.
They can take full advantage of the CPU, GPU, and other hardware resources, which is especially important for tasks like gaming, video editing, and data analysis.
Offline Functionality
Web apps often require an internet connection to function fully. Desktop apps can be designed to work offline or with limited connectivity, which is a big plus for users who need reliability in poor network conditions.
Native Integration
Desktop apps can offer tighter integration with the operating system:
System notifications
File system access
Advanced input (e.g., touchscreen, pen, and stylus support)
Access to hardware like cameras, microphones, and GPUs
These capabilities can be game-changers for professional apps or tools.
Enhanced User Experience
Desktop apps often provide a richer, more polished user experience with better customization and responsiveness compared to many web apps.
They can also leverage platform-specific design languages (e.g., macOS’s Cocoa, Windows’ Fluent Design) to feel more "native."
Privacy and Security
Desktop apps can function without constant data collection or tracking, which is common in web apps.
Users often feel more in control of their data when using a desktop app, especially for sensitive tasks like financial management or local file editing.
App Stores Lower Distribution Barriers
The availability of desktop app stores (like the Mac App Store) simplifies distribution, updates, and discovery, similar to mobile apps.
Developers no longer need to rely solely on their own websites for app distribution, which helps overcome the traditional challenge of making desktop apps accessible.
2. Challenges Desktop Apps Face
Cross-Platform Development
One reason web apps dominate is their cross-platform nature—users can access them on any device with a browser.
To compete, desktop apps need to be cross-platform too, which can be expensive and time-consuming unless developers use frameworks like Electron, Qt, or Flutter.
User Convenience
Web apps don’t require installation and are instantly accessible, which appeals to users who prioritize simplicity.
To rival this, desktop apps must offer seamless installation and updates, which app stores already help facilitate.
Evolving User Habits
Many users are now accustomed to browser-based workflows and are hesitant to switch back to standalone apps unless the benefits are clear and compelling.
3. Emerging Trends Supporting Desktop Apps
Hybrid Apps
Frameworks like Electron, Tauri, or Flutter enable developers to create desktop apps that behave like web apps but offer native performance and offline functionality.
These apps blur the line between traditional desktop apps and web apps, giving the best of both worlds.
Focus on Privacy
With increasing concerns over privacy and data tracking, desktop apps that don’t depend on cloud services or third-party servers could appeal to users seeking more secure alternatives to web apps.
Subscription Models
App store integration allows developers to monetize through subscriptions, similar to mobile apps. Users are now accustomed to paying for premium software, thanks to mobile ecosystems.
Specialized Tools
Web apps can’t compete with desktop apps for certain specialized use cases like 3D modeling, video editing, gaming, and data-heavy applications.
Developers targeting these niches can leverage app stores to reach new audiences.
4. Desktop vs. Web Apps: Coexistence
Rather than one replacing the other, desktop and web apps will likely coexist, with each dominating certain areas:

Desktop Apps: Best for performance-heavy, specialized, or privacy-focused use cases.
Web Apps: Best for convenience, collaboration, and apps requiring frequent updates.
Conclusion: Can Desktop Apps Make a Comeback?
Yes, desktop apps have the potential to regain significant ground over web apps, especially as app stores make them easier to discover and manage. However, their comeback will depend on:

Leveraging native advantages (performance, integration, offline capabilities).
Adopting modern frameworks for cross-platform compatibility.
Offering a compelling user experience that justifies leaving the browser.
The trend is already shifting in areas like gaming (e.g., Steam Deck, Xbox Game Pass) and productivity tools (e.g., Notion, Obsidian). With the right strategy, desktop apps could become a preferred choice for many users once again.
